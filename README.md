# Likelihood-based estimation of discrimination accuracy measures for time-to-event outcomes with a cured fraction
This repository contains code related to the paper "Likelihood-based estimation of discrimination accuracy measures for time-to-event outcomes with a cured fraction".

The code reproduces the results of the section: "Simulation studies".

The computational implementations of the proposed methods were carried out using the R programming language. The R packages used are the following: VGAM, copula, sn, survival, flux, tdROC, survivalROC, DescTools, spatstat.geom, and risksetROC.
